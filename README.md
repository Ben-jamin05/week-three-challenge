# Week Three Challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to add functions to make the website work as intended. This consists of adding functionality to the "Add Employees" button by completing the collectEmployees function, display the average salary to the console with the displayAverageSalary function, and lastly to select and print out a random employee to the console with the getRandomEmployee function. I accomplished this by using the knowledge of loops and functions gained from this week in class. 

## Installation

You can either just go to the website from the Github repository or via this [link](https://ben-jamin05.github.io/week-three-challenge/) or clone the code from the repository. 

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the website it should look something like [This](./assets/images/Screenshot%202024-04-18%20at%209.19.51â€¯PM.png). You will see a blue "Add Employees" button on the center of the page. Once you have clicked the button it will prompt you with the first employees first name, then after you have entered that it will ask you for the last name, and then their salary. You will be prompted with the option to add another employee and it will take you through this process as many times as you would like until you click cancel. Beware if you enter a nonnumber value on the salary prompt their salary will be zero. After you are done entering you infromation you should see all of your employees in a table on your screen. If you naviage to the dev tools and go to the console it will display the average salary of your employees and also display a randomly selected employee.
